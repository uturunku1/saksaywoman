        <h3>What's in my family name </h3>

            <p> Like most women who are about to get married, I found myself in the position
            of deciding whether or not to change my last name for his. In my case, it was a
            very easy decision to make because, since I was 15 years old, I had embraced my
            father’s last name with such pride that I could never picture myself having another
            last name. I say 15 years old because when I was younger I was easily embarrassed
            by my friend’s jokes about my unpronounceable, unreadable last name:
            H-U- A-Y- H-U- A-C-A. Pronounced: “Why-walk- ah”. And since most last names in Peru
            are either in Spanish, Italian or German, I was always seen as different, as an
            Andean that came from a Quechua-speaking family. Only as I grew up did I come to
            realize how cool it was to be different. I became very well acquainted with the
            interesting Huayhuaca family history, that nowadays I enjoy talking about whenever
            I get the chance. Now I find it funny when I see someone struggling to pronounce
            my last name. </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, I don’t carry my mother’s last name and also never got to meet her family. Her family’s name: Uturunku, with such guttural and powerful resonance, was always a mystery to me. I know little about its origins and history. I know its meaning however: Jaguar.</p>


            <p>My mother didn’t get to know her father well, neither the Uturunku lineage. Her mom took her away from her
            dad’s side when she was just a baby. But when she was 13, she snuck away to visit her father in his small hometown,
            in Cusco, Huarocondo. That was probably one of the most disappointing episodes of her life.</p>
            <p>Her mother had always talked about a beautiful shawl that the Uturunku family had passed from generation to generation to the eldest daughters of the family. When my mother went to visit her dad, yes, she was looking to rekindle with him, but also looking for the famous shawl that in theory belonged it to my mom. He bluntly denied it to her. Her dad told her he was going to give it to the daughter he had had with his new wife, the one he had left my grandma for.
            My mother left his house to never look back again. It took her exactly 46 years to forgive her dad. One day, out of the blue, mother told me, “I want to visit the place where I was born”;  I knew what this meant. I had been planning this trip forever, the day I would be taken by my mother to meet the Uturunku family.</p>


            <p>On our way to Huarocondo, Cusco, my mother told me how her mom had gotten together with her dad. Andeans have a very reserved, quiet nature, so when my mother said that the way her dad had shown interest in her mom was by gently sliding a little piece of rock next to her feet, and that she had shown interest back by sliding another little piece of rock to his feet, it sounded about right.</p>
            <p>It wasn’t difficult to find the family. When we ask people from downtown Huarocondo if they knew where the Uturunku family was, they didn’t hesitate to reply, “On the street they always lived on”. To my surprise, the Uturunku family, for many generations, had always lived on the same street.  Funny enough, my mom’s mom’s relatives were also still in the same neighborhood and, as a matter of fact, had married other members of the Uturunku family . Between those two families, they owned four blocks of that small town.</p>
            <p>Recently I discovered The Genographic Project, a DNA test to map your family’s ancestry. When I looked at the reference populations that the project has so far, I found that Andean Peruvians have the lowest genetic variation.  Or, to put it simply, they are the least mixed human group in the world.  They are 96 % Native American and 4% European Mediterranean. This fascinates me, and kind of disturbs me at the same time as we have all heard about the negative side effects of inbreeding.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, I was charmed by this little town where everybody knew each other. With tall majestic Andean hills, acres and acres of green fields, and clean narrow streets with pretty houses made of adobe, I couldn’t imagine a better place to retire. And even though everyone spoke Quechua there, and only my mom only understood what they were saying, I could feel the warm welcome that they were giving us as foreigners. My mother was excited to meet aunts, uncles, and siblings she had never known until then. The only one she didn’t get to say hello was her father. Her half-sister told us that he had passed away four years ago. My mother didn’t cry, but she was disappointed and guilty that she never gotten the chance to make peace with this man.</p>
            <p>Soon after that, we head back home, to Lima. We promised our newly met family that we would come back. I know that my mother surely wants to reunite with her “new” family as soon as she retires. And as for me, I know that I still have much more to unravel about my past. I just hope I get the chance to do it sometime in the not so distant future.</p>

        <h3> On Portland's Weirdness </h3>
        <footer>
            <p><h4>This content was posted on June, 2016<h4></p>
        </footer>
            <p> As an expat that comes from a big city (I grew up in Lima), Portland, Oregon seems so small and quiet. People that live here keep telling me how fast is growing, and indeed, in my 4 years living here I’ve noticed the changes.
                Still, it seems that my longest drive will be roughly 30 minutes, and not even on the warmest day on the summer, in the middle of downtown, I have the need to step aside to share the sidewalk with others. Is great.</p>


            <p> Is Portland weird? I can’t really tell since everything in this country, in general, is still sort of weird and new to me. It fascinates me when the locals go out to the parks on a sunny day, shirtless or in their bathing suit
                to take sun bathes for hours on end. They are the picture of happiness and there should postcards of it. If I approach the locals to ask, say for directions or the name of their puppy, their eyes will brighten up
                and a big smile will appear on their faces, while they expand on their answer for as long as they can. Is like time doesn’t pass for them and they're looking to make friends. I envy small-town attitude.</p>


            <p> I love how peaceful Portland is, not just because how slow life moves here, but how people prefer bikes than cars, hikes than bar hopping, and how much green I’m surrounded by. Portland has the smallest and the biggest park in the US within city limits, look it up.
                I can’t count how many times I have stopped to take my picture with some rare flower or tree. Though, I must admit I loose that serene attitude when I’m behind a slow group of bikers,
                the brewcycle or the streetcar, BUT, you gotta respect their culture.</p>

            <p> Is Portland very white? I guess there is a lot of Caucasian locals fellows out there. Even more if all those white immigrants from Mexico and Middle east where to be consider in the demographics. But one the fascinating facts I learned in this country is that white and immigrant
                are two words that contradict each other.</p>

            <p> What I like best about the looks of the locals is their clothing. Is so exotic and multifaceted. Some tight jeans, modest t-shirt and interesting looking hat seems like it works in any kind of environment, office, Friday night, fancy restaurant, you name it.
                And when it rains, which happens a lot, people don’t use umbrellas, they just get wet and don’t care how they look. They’re humble.</p>


            <p> So many other things that I find captivating about this country, but I’ll leave it for later. I’m learning to embrace the “no rush, chill out” attitude to, someday, pass by a native.</p>

        <h3>Finding Our Way Home</h3>

            <p> Mike moved to Lima to be with me. One thing is to visit a guy in another country because you have a crush on him, and one completely different to see him move in to your country to settle down. </p>

            <p> It was exciting the process of leaving my dad’s house, finding an apartment to live with my boyfriend. Things were moving fast and I didn’t have time to consider the big step we were both taking. </p>

            <p> In the year and 3 months that we lived together in Lima, we had so many plans, fun and fights that it caught me by surprise when he said one day: I miss home (Portland, Oregon), and I want to come back. It was the perfect time for him to miss home,
                since his brother-in-law in Portland was looking for a new assistant and had offered him the job.</p>

            <p> Knowing Mike, it would have never occurred to me to put the word "insurance" and "Mike" in the same sentence. But Mike missed home and being an insurance man suddenly didn’t sound such crazy idea.
                I guess I never expected for him to feel like at home in Peru, neither to fall in love with his job in Lima, that was mediocre and run by a micromanager hateful man.</p>

            <p> So one day he took the risk and said to me: I’m moving back to Portland, do you want to come with me… married?
                When layed like that the situation,I didn’t seem appropriate to be jumping up and down saying yes, yes. My answer was a rational and calm as his proposal: let me consider this and I’ll get back to you.</p>

            <p> I’m not a romantic woman, I don’t care for extravagant proposals or dreamy weddings. All I knew is that I wanted to be with Mike, and if that meant leaving my comfort zone, it would have to be one or the other.</P>

            <p> My answer was yes. We had a small, simple civic wedding and then it came the visa process. All of sudden I was living in Portland. No job, no friends or family. Just a brand-new husband to start a new home.</p>
